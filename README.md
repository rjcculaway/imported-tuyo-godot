# Imported Tuyo
Godot port of Shane's Fishing Adventure, originally written in Java/JavaFX. You can play the game on [Itch.io](https://renejotham.itch.io/imported-tuyo).

## Fishing
Help us fish for goldfish, tilapia, and tawilis!
If you see fish approaching, simply type the word on them to catch them! Matching words are highlighted in yellow. If a fish gets past you, you lose one (1) life! If you lose all three (3) lives, the game will end.
## Fish Net

As you catch fish, you will gain fish net power. Once it fills, press SPACE to capture all of the fish present.
## Correcting Mistakes

You can correct your mistakes by pressing TAB. Beware! This eats at your fish net power.

## Mermaid

At certain points in the game, a magical mermaid will appear! The mermaid will bless you with bubbles, which provide a substantial increase to your fish net power and score. Be sure to catch them all!
